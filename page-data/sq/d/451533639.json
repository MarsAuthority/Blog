You can go back with `ctrl+-`. Here, go to your [[inbox]]\r\n\r\n- [ ] to see how your notes are connected, execute the `Foam: Show Graph` command. See [[graph-visualization]].\r\n\r\n- [ ] #tags can be used to further organize your content. Look at the `Tag Explorer` view on the left panel to find and navigate the tags in your knowledge base. See [[tags-and-tag-explorer]].\r\n\r\n- [ ] Foam supports [[spell-checking]].\r\n\r\n- [ ] You can also paste images in your Foam, just press `cmd+alt+v` to create the image file and link to it from your note. See [[paste-images-from-clipboard]].\r\n\r\n- [ ] You can use Foam for your daily notes, or journaling. Execute now the `Foam: Open Daily Note` command to create a new file in your `journal` folder. See [[daily-notes]].\r\n\r\n- [ ] Want to see how to manage your tasks? Go to the [[todo]] note\r\n\r\n- [ ] The section at the end of this file contains wikilink definitions, which enable navigation of your notes from GitHub's web UI, and in general to make `[[wikilinks]]` understood by any markdown parser. See [[link-reference-definitions]].\r\n\r\n- [ ] To explore all the Foam settings, press `cmd+,`, then `Extensions > Foam`\r\n\r\n- [ ] Living within VsCode, Foam can be customized in many ways!

No vendor lock-in. The less vendor features you use, the better you'll be able to migrate. `[[Wikilink]]` is the only non-markdown feature supported by default, but nonetheless, it is recommended to use the standard markdown syntax, or if you edit with [Foam](https://github.com/foambubble/foam), please use [Wikilink](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/wikilinks) with [Link Reference Definitions](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/features/link-reference-definitions). That give us the capability change our theme, or hosted place.\r\n2. Use meta data instead of special characters. We should use `tags` as the document's metadata, not `#tag` in the plain text.\r\n3. Use tags instead of categories. Minimal subfolders.\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\n\r\n### For new wiki\r\n\r\nThis documentation assumes that you have a GitHub account and have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed on your Linux/MacOS/Windows machine.\r\n\r\n1. If you haven't yet, browse over to the main [Foam documentation](https://foambubble.github.io/foam) to get an idea of what Foam is and how to use it.\r\n2. Press \"Use this template\" button at [foam-template-gatsby-theme-primer-wiki](https://github.com/theowenyoung/foam-template-gatsby-theme-primer-wiki/generate) (that's this repository!) to fork it to your own GitHub account. If you want to keep your thoughts to yourself, remember to set the repository private.\r\n3. [Clone the repository to your local machine](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) and open it in VS Code.\r\n\r\n   _Open the repository as a folder using the `File > Open...` menu item._\r\n\r\n4. When prompted to install recommended extensions, click **Install all** (or **Show Recommendations** if you want to review and install them one by one)\r\n5. Delete all `.md` files you don't need, Change Site settings at `.layouts/gatsby-config.js`, change your CNAME at `.layouts/static/CNAME`, change your icon at `.layouts/static/logo.png`, commit your changes, and push to github, change your page settings at Github, make sure you set the page branch to `gh-pages`, then when github actions runed, you can visit your site.\r\n\r\nAfter setting up the repository, head to [[getting-started]] to get familiar with your new knowledge base!\r\n\r\nTo learn more about how to use **Foam**, read the [Recipes](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recipes/recipes) bubbles of the Foam documentation workspace.\r\n\r\nAnd remember that you can always join our [Foam community on Discord](https://foambubble.github.io/join-discord/g)!\r\n\r\n### For exist wiki\r\n\r\n### Exist Wiki\r\n\r\n1.

Gigamon Solution\r\n- **无源TAP**\r\n  - 无源TAP是在其网络端口之间没有物理隔离的设备，它从网络的两个方向接收流量，以便在监视工具上看到100％的流量。无源TAP不需要任何电源，增加了一层冗余，几乎不需要维护，并减少了总费用。\r\n- **有源TAP**\r\n  - 有源TAP在网络端口之间具有物理隔离。因此，它们需要一种故障安全机制，以确保在TAP断电时网络保持可操作状态；**有源TAP通常在下面的场景使用（无源TAP不适用）**：\r\n    1. Locations where the light levels are too low to use a splitter → regeneration provides a viable solution\r\n    2. Copper infrastructures → where electricity is used to move electrons (instead of photons)\r\n    3. Signal conversions → since an active TAP regenerates the signal anyway, it can also be designed to create a signal of a different type (such as 10Gb SR converted to 10Gb LR)\r\n    4. SFP-based links that cannot otherwise be broken (such as TwinAX cabling) → regeneration works here as well\r\n- **虚拟TAP**\r\n  - 用于网络功能虚拟化 (NFV) 以及私有和公共云基础架构，以访问托管环境中的东西向和南北向流量。\r\n  - ![hKxsTy](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/MarsAuthority/sec_pic@master/uPic/2022-12/hKxsTy.jpg)\r\n\r\n# 4. 参考资料\r\n- [https://www.gigamon.com/resources/resource-library/white-paper/to-tap-or-to-span.html](https://www.gigamon.com/resources/resource-library/white-paper/to-tap-or-to-span.html)\r\n- [https://www.gigamon.com/resources/resource-library/white-paper/understanding-network-taps-first-step-to-visibility.html](https://www.gigamon.com/resources/resource-library/white-paper/understanding-network-taps-first-step-to-visibility.html)\r\n- [https://www.secrss.com/articles/12651](https://www.secrss.com/articles/12651)\r\n- [http://blog.nsfocus.net/east-west-flow-sum](http://blog.nsfocus.net/east-west-flow-sum)"},{"fields":{"slug":"/安全知识库/Blue Team基础设施/终端基础设施/EDR/2021 EPP魔力象限 EPP Magic Quadrant/","title":"2021 EPP魔力象限 EPP Magic Quadrant"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\r\ntitle: 2021 EPP魔力象限 EPP Magic Quadrant\r\ntags:\r\n- Blue Team基础设施\r\n- 终端基础设施\r\n- EDR\r\n---\r\n\r\n![https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/MarsAuthority/sec_pic@master/uPic/2023-01/ZP3Qyi.jpg](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/MarsAuthority/sec_pic@master/uPic/2023-01/ZP3Qyi.jpg)\r\n\r\n# 1. 市场趋势\r\n- 到 2023 年底，云交付的 EPP 解决方案将超过 95% 。\r\n- 到 2025 年，50% 使用 EDR 的组织将使用托管检测和响应功能（MDR）。\r\n- 到 2025 年，60% 的 EDR 解决方案将包含来自多个安全控制源的数据，例如身份认证、CASB 和 DLP。\r\n\r\n# 2. 市场定义/描述\r\n- Gartner对EPP市场的定义如下：EPP提供了将agent或sensor部署到托管终端（包括 PC、服务器和其他设备）的工具；这些旨在防止一系列已知和未知的恶意软件和威胁，并提供免受此类威胁的保护；此外，它们还提供调查和补救任何逃避保护控制的事件的能力。\r\n- EPP的核心功能是：\r\n  -

首先，服务器业务进程优先级高，HIDS Agent进程自己可以终止，但不能影响宿主机的主要业务，这是第一要点，那么业务需要具备熔断功能，并具备自我恢复能力。\r\n  - 其次，进程保活、维持心跳、实时获取新指令能力，百万台Agent的全量控制时间一定要短。举个极端的例子，当Agent出现紧急情况，需要全量停止时，那么全量停止的命令下发，需要在1-2分钟内完成，甚至30秒、20秒内完成。这些将会是很大的技术挑战。\r\n  - 还有对配置动态更新，日志级别控制，细分精确控制到每个Agent上的每个HIDS子进程，能自由地控制每个进程的启停，每个Agent的参数，也能精确的感知每台Agent的上线、下线情况。\r\n  - 同时，Agent本身是安全Agent，安全的因素也要考虑进去，包括通信通道的安全性，配置管理的安全性等等。\r\n  - 最后，服务端也要有一致性保障、可用性保障，对于大量Agent的管理，必须能实现任务分摊，并行处理任务，且保证数据的一致性。考虑到公司规模不断地扩大，业务不断地增多，特别是美团和大众点评合并后，面对的各种操作系统问题，产品还要具备良好的兼容性、可维护性等。\r\n  - 总结下来，产品架构要符合以下特性：\r\n    - 集群高可用。\r\n    - 分布式，去中心化。\r\n    - 配置一致性，配置多版本可追溯。\r\n    - 分治与汇总。\r\n    - 兼容部署各种Linux 服务器，只维护一个版本。\r\n    - 节省资源，占用较少的CPU、内存。\r\n    - 精确的熔断限流。\r\n    - 服务器数量规模达到百万级的集群负载能力。\r\n\r\n# 5. 技术难点：\r\n在列出产品需要实现的功能点、技术点后，再来分析下遇到的技术挑战，包括不限于以下几点：\r\n\r\n- 资源限制，较小的CPU、内存。\r\n- 五十万甚至一百万台服务器的Agent处理控制问题。\r\n- 量级大了后，集群控制带来的控制效率，响应延迟，数据一致性问题。\r\n- 量级大了后，数据传输对整个服务器内网带来的流量冲击问题。\r\n- 量级大了后，运行环境更复杂，Agent异常表现的感知问题。\r\n- 量级大了后，业务日志、程序运行日志的传输、存储问题，被监控业务访问量突增带来监控数据联突增，对内网带宽，存储集群的爆发压力问题。\r\n\r\n我们可以看到，技术难点几乎都是服务器到达一定量级带来的，对于大量的服务，集群分布式是业界常见的解决方案。\r\n\r\n# 6. 架构设计与技术选型\r\n对于管理Agent的服务端来说，要实现高可用、容灾设计，那么一定要做多机房部署，就一定会遇到数据一致性问题。那么数据的存储，就要考虑分布式存储组件。 分布式数据存储中，存在一个定理叫`CAP定理`：\r\n\r\n![lxjgAk](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/MarsAuthority/sec_pic@master/uPic/2023-01/lxjgAk.jpg)\r\n\r\n**CAP的解释**:\r\n- 关于`CAP定理`，分为以下三点：\r\n  - 一致性（Consistency）：分布式数据库的数据保持一致。\r\n  - 可用性（Availability）：任何一个节点宕机，其他节点可以继续对外提供服务。\r\n  - 分区容错性（网络分区）Partition Tolerance：一个数据库所在的机器坏了，如硬盘坏了，数据丢失了，可以添加一台机器，然后从其他正常的机器把备份的数据同步过来。\r\n- 根据定理，分布式系统只能满足三项中的两项而不可能满足全部三项。理解CAP定理的最简单方式是想象两个节点分处分区两侧。允许至少一个节点更新状态会导致数据不一致，即丧失了Consistency。如果为了保证数据一致性，将分区一侧的节点设置为不可用，那么又丧失了Availability。除非两个节点可以互相通信，才能既保证Consistency又保证Availability，这又会导致丧失Partition Tolerance。\r\n- 参见：[CAP Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem)\r\n\r\n**CAP的选择**:\r\n- 为了容灾上设计，集群节点的部署，会选择的异地多机房，所以 「Partition tolerance」是不可能避免的。那么可选的是 `AP` 与 `CP`。\r\n- 在HIDS集群的场景里，各个Agent对集群持续可用性没有非常强的要求，在短暂时间内，是可以出现异常，出现无法通讯的情况。但最终状态必须要一致，不能存在集群下发关停指令，而出现个别Agent不听从集群控制的情况出现。所以，我们需要一个满足 `CP` 的产品。\r\n\r\n# 7. 满足CP的产品选择\r\n  - 在开源社区中，比较出名的几款满足CP的产品，比如etcd、ZooKeeper、Consul等。我们需要根据几款产品的特点，根据我们需求来选择符合我们需求的产品。\r\n  - 插一句，网上很多人说Consul是AP产品，这是个错误的描述。既然Consul支持分布式部署，那么一定会出现「网络分区」的问题， 那么一定要支持「Partition tolerance」。另外，在consul的官网上自己也提到了这点 Consul uses a CP architecture, favoring consistency over availability.\r\n  \r\n    > Consul is opinionated in its usage while Serf is a more flexible and general purpose tool. In CAP terms, Consul uses a CP architecture, favoring consistency over availability. Serf is an AP system and sacrifices consistency for availability. This means Consul cannot operate if the central servers cannot form a quorum while Serf will continue to function under almost all circumstances.\r\n\r\n  - **etcd、ZooKeeper、Consul对比**\r\n\r\n    - 借用etcd官网上etcd与ZooKeeper和Consul的比较图。\r\n    - ![XotcyC](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/MarsAuthority/sec_pic@master/uPic/2023-01/XotcyC.jpg)\r\n    - 在我们HIDS Agent的需求中，除了基本的`服务发现` 、`配置同步` 、`配置多版本控制` 、`变更通知`等基本需求外，我们还有基于产品安全性上的考虑，比如`传输通道加密`、`用户权限控制`、`角色管理`、`基于Key的权限设定`等，这点 `etcd` 比较符合我们要求。很多大型公司都在使用，比如`Kubernetes`、`AWS`、`OpenStack`、`Azure`、`Google Cloud`、`Huawei Cloud`等，并且`etcd`的社区支持非常好。基于这几点因素，我们选择etcd作为HIDS的分布式集群管理。\r\n\r\n# 8. 分布式HIDS集群架构图\r\n![c09vZx](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/MarsAuthority/sec_pic@master/uPic/2023-01/c09vZx.jpg)\r\n\r\n# 9. 编程语言选择\r\n考虑到公司服务器量大，业务复杂，需求环境多变，操作系统可能包括各种Linux以及Windows等。为了保证系统的兼容性，我们选择了Golang作为开发语言，它具备以下特点：\r\n\r\n- 可以静态编译，直接通过syscall来运行，不依赖libc，兼容性高，可以在所有Linux上执行，部署便捷。\r\n- 静态编译语言，能将简单的错误在编译前就发现。\r\n- 具备良好的GC机制，占用系统资源少，开发成本低。\r\n- 容器化的很多产品都是Golang编写，比如Kubernetes、Docker等。\r\n- etcd项目也是Golang编写，类库、测试用例可以直接用，SDK支持快速。\r\n- 良好的CSP并发模型支持，高效的协程调度机制。\r\n\r\n# 10. 产品架构大方向\r\n  - HIDS产品研发完成后，部署的服务都运行着各种业务的服务器，业务的重要性排在第一，我们产品的功能排在后面。为此，确定了几个产品的大方向：\r\n    - 高可用，数据一致，可横向扩展。\r\n    - 容灾性好，能应对机房级的网络故障。\r\n    - 兼容性好，只维护一个版本的Agent。\r\n    - 依赖低，不依赖任何动态链接库。\r\n    - 侵入性低，不做Hook，不做系统类库更改。\r\n    - 熔断降级可靠，宁可自己挂掉，也不影响业务 。\r\n\r\n# 11. 框架设计\r\n![XMnpix](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/MarsAuthority/sec_pic@master/uPic/2023-01/XMnpix.jpg)\r\n\r\n如上图，在框架的设计上，封装常用类库，抽象化定义`Interface`，剥离`etcd Client`，全局化`Logger`，抽象化App的启动、退出方法。使得各`模块`（以下简称`App`）只需要实现自己的业务即可，可以方便快捷的进行逻辑编写，无需关心底层实现、配置来源、重试次数、熔断方案等等。\r\n\r\n后面不再copy，感兴趣请参考原文"},{"fields":{"slug":"/安全知识库/Blue Team基础设施/终端基础设施/EDR商业化产品/CrowdStrike Falcon/","title":"CrowdStrike Falcon"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\r\ntitle: CrowdStrike Falcon\r\ntags:\r\n- Blue Team基础设施\r\n- 终端基础设施\r\n- EDR商业化产品\r\n- CrowdStrike\r\n---\r\n\r\n# 1. CrowdStrike EDR 解决方案中最重要的是什么？\r\n![NsTQNy](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/MarsAuthority/sec_pic@master/uPic/2023-01/NsTQNy.jpg)\r\n\r\n- **找到能够提供最高级别的保护同时需要最少的努力和投资的 EDR 安全解决方案非常重要**——在不耗尽资源的情况下为您的安全团队增加价值。以下是您应该寻找的 EDR 的六个关键方面：\r\n\r\n  - **可见度：**跨所有终端的实时可见性，从而可以检测发现攻击者活动，进而实施阻断。\r\n  - **威胁数据库：**EDR 需要从终端收集大量遥测数据并丰富上下文，因此可以使用各种分析技术挖掘攻击迹象。\r\n  - **行为保护：**仅依赖基于签名或IOC会导致检测能力被轻易绕过，从而导致数据泄露；EDR需要能通过行为来搜索攻击指标 (IOAs，crowdstrike发明的)，以便在发生危害之前收到可疑活动的告警。\r\n\r\n- TODO > 什么是攻击指标 Indicators of attack (IOA)？\r\n  攻击指标 (IOA)侧重于检测攻击者试图完成的目标的意图，而不管攻击中使用的恶意软件或漏洞。就像杀毒软件的签名一样，基于 IOC 的检测方法无法检测到0day攻击和免杀恶意软件。\r\n\r\n  >比如鱼叉攻击，必须欺骗目标点击链接或打开恶意文件/文档，一旦机器沦陷，攻击者将默默地执行另一个进程，隐藏在内存或磁盘中，并在系统重新启动后维持权限；然后与C2联系，等待进一步的指示。\r\n  >\r\n  >IOA 关注这些具体步骤的执行、对手的意图以及他试图实现的结果。IOA并不关注他用来实现目标的特定工具，而实监控关键行动，通过有状态执行检查引擎(Stateful Execution Inspection Engine)来收集和使用指标(indicators )，我们可以确定攻击者如何成功访问网络并推断其意图。\r\n\r\n  - **洞察力和智慧：**集成威胁情报的EDR解决方案可以提供上下文，包括攻击您的特定对手的详细信息或有关攻击的其他信息。\r\n  - **快速响应：**EDR能够对事件做出快速准确的响应，可以在攻击造成影响之前阻止攻击，并快速恢复业务。\r\n  - **基于云：**基于云的EDR解决方案可以降低对终端的影响，同时确保可以准确、实时地完成搜索、分析和调查等功能。\r\n\r\n# 2. CrowdStrike EDR 是如何工作的？\r\n- EDR解决方案的工作原理是提供对终端上发生事情的持续和全面的实时检测/监控。然后将行为分析和可操作的情报应用于终端数据，以阻止攻击告警演变为安全事件。功能包括：\r\n  - **1. 自动发现未知攻击者**\r\n    - Falcon Insight 将所有终端的遥测数据与IOA配对，并使用其行为来分析数十亿事件，自动检测可疑行为的痕迹；如果一系列事件和告警与已知 IOA匹配，agent将把该活动标记为恶意并自动发送告警；用户还可以编写自己的搜索条件，Falcon Insight的云架构可在5 秒或更短的时间内返回查询结果。\r\n  - **2. 与威胁情报集成**\r\n    - 可以更快地检测被识别为恶意的TTPs，并提供了上下文信息，其中包括相关的归因，提供有关攻击者的详细信息以及有关攻击的任何其他信息。\r\n  - **3. 主动防御，托管式威胁狩猎**\r\n    - 作为 Falcon 平台的一部分，Falcon OverWatch™ 托管威胁追踪服务增加了一个额外的保护能力，安全专家会帮助客户采取行动，以确保不会遗漏威胁，并最终防止发生大规模泄露。\r\n  - **4. 提供实时/历史的可见性**\r\n    - Falcon Insight就像终端上的 DVR，记录相关活动以捕捉尝试绕过检测的安全事件；Falcon agent跟踪了数百个不同的安全相关事件，例如进程创建、驱动程序加载、注册表修改、磁盘访问、内存访问或网络连接等，客户可以从安全角度全面了解其终端上发生的一切。\r\n    - 这为安全团队提供了他们需要的有用信息，包括：\r\n      - 内外与外部的网络连接\r\n      - 直接/远程登录的所有用户帐户\r\n      - ASP 密钥的变更、可执行文件和管理工具的使用\r\n      - 进程执行\r\n      - 详细的进程级别的网络活动，包括 DNS 请求、连接和开放端口\r\n      - 存档文件创建，包括 RAR 和 ZIPS\r\n      - USB等外部存储介质\r\n  - **5. 加速调查**\r\n    - 能够加快调查和最终修复的速度，因为从终端收集的信息通过Falcon 平台存储在 CrowdStrike 云中，使用了一个图形数据库来跟踪每个终端事件之间的所有关系和联系，该数据库可以快速、大规模地提供历史和实时数据的详细信息和上下文，这使安全团队能够有效地跟踪即使是最复杂的攻击，并及时发现事件，并对它们进行分类、验证和确定优先级，从而更快、更精确地进行补救。\r\n  - **6. 实现快速的修复**\r\n    - Falcon Insight 可以隔离终端，它允许组织通过将可能受到威胁的主机与所有网络活动隔离开来采取迅速和即时的行动。当终端受被隔离，它仍然可以从 CrowdStrike 云发送和接收信息，但即使与云的连接被切断，它仍将保持被隔离，并在重新启动期间保持这种隔离状态。\r\n    - **在应对新出现的威胁时，时间至关重要，响应者需要实时、深入的可见性，以便他们能够快速果断地进行补救。**\r\n    - **信息收集器**允许安全团队通过执行以下任务，以了解威胁的风险和范围：\r\n      - 浏览文件系统并提取文件\r\n      - 列出正在运行的进程\r\n      - 提取 Windows 事件日志\r\n      - 查询 Windows 注册表\r\n      - 列出当前的网络连接和配置\r\n      - 提取进程内存\r\n      - 计算文件哈希\r\n      - 收集环境变量\r\n      - 使用 PowerShell 或其他工具收集其他所需信息\r\n    - **补救措施**使团队能够迅速而果断地采取行动来遏制或补救威胁，包括：\r\n      - 删除文件\r\n      - 结束一个进程\r\n      - 删除或修改 Windows 注册表项或值\r\n      - 上传文件\r\n      - 运行脚本或可执行文件\r\n      - 加密文件\r\n      - 重启/关机\r\n- 借助 CrowdStrike 的云原生架构、轻量级agent和统一控制台，实时响应功能可以交付到世界上任何地方的任何系统，而对成本或性能的影响几乎为零。\r\n\r\n# 3. 参考资料\r\n- [https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/indicators-of-compromise/ioa-vs-ioc/](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/indicators-of-compromise/ioa-vs-ioc/)\r\n- [https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/endpoint-security/endpoint-detection-and-response-edr/](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/endpoint-security/endpoint-detection-and-response-edr/)"},{"fields":{"slug":"/安全知识库/Blue Team基础设施/终端基础设施/EDR能力评估/MITRE EDR技术能力评估/","title":"MITRE EDR技术能力评估"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\r\ntitle: MITRE EDR技术能力评估\r\ntags:\r\n- Blue Team基础设施\r\n- 终端基础设施\r\n- EDR能力评估\r\n- MITRE\r\n---\r\n\r\n# 1. 背景\r\nMITRE每年会举办一次安全产品能力评估，通过ATT&CK和真实的APT案例进行攻击模拟，最大程度环境真实的攻击场景，整体过程分为以下三步：\r\n- **1. 设计阶段**\r\n  -

![9P2IbH](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/MarsAuthority/sec_pic@master/uPic/2023-01/9P2IbH.jpg)\r\n  - 厂商提供的解决方案：MDR和MSSP。\r\n- 部署时对业务有什么影响？\r\n  - EDR 解决方案应该可以使用任何本机或第三方部署实用程序轻松部署到终端。 需要重启的解决方案可能会产生重大的业务影响，并需要更多的组织协调。\r\n- 能否取代现有的终端安全方案？\r\n  - 今天的许多 EDR 解决方案并不直接取代常见的安全方案，而是专注于加强安全态势的特定部分；常见的现有终端安全方案有：\r\n    - 杀毒软件、DLP、FIM、HIDS、UBA等。\r\n\r\n**技术能力**\r\n- 支持哪些平台和操作系统？\r\n  - 理想情况下，单一解决方案将适用于服务器、PC、笔记本电脑和其他终端。\r\n- 提供什么级别的可见性？\r\n  - 如果 EDR 缺乏对数据的收集，则它的价值有限； 把它想象成一个物理安全系统：光学安全摄像头远不如能同时收集 X 射线、红外线和振动数据的摄像头。\r\n  - 常见的数据包含：进程信息、网络连接、文件修改记录、注册表记录、二进制文件、内容、用户信息等。\r\n- 如何与预防措施相结合？\r\n  - EDR 解决方案越来越多地成为终端保护平台的一部分，而不是独立的工具。 选择具有“多合一”的解决方案非常重要。\r\n- 如何检测面临的威胁？\r\n  - 了解 EDR 解决方案检测到的威胁类型以及使用的技术和技巧应该是评估的核心。 许多解决方案采用非常有限的检测方法，并且无法提供更广泛的威胁覆盖范围。\r\n  - 包含：覆盖范围、误报率、漏报率、响应时间、有效性等。\r\n- 提供什么样的响应处置能力？\r\n  - 需要能够立即对威胁做出反应并在它对您的组织造成更大损害之前阻止它。\r\n- 有哪些类型的报告可用？\r\n  - EDR 解决方案提供的报告对于获得的价值至关重要；这适用于随每个威胁检测提供的报告以及有关终端和企业的摘要报告。\r\n\r\n**安全能力整合**\r\n- 是否与其他安全工具集成/联动？\r\n  - 将 EDR 深度集成到现有的安全能力和 IT 工具，能够最有效地从解决方案中获得最大价值。\r\n- 对终端会造成什么影响?\r\n  - 几乎所有 EDR 解决方案都通过Agent方式部署到终端，这意味着如果它没有经过良好的设计和测试，可能会产生严重的性能影响并导致不稳定。 应该提供在类似操作系统和硬件上测试的性能数据，以及在运行类似应用程序时的性能数据。\r\n- 使用哪些安全控制来保护自己免受攻击者的攻击？\r\n  - 如果设计不当，EDR 解决方案可能会带来巨大的安全风险；确保EDR自身都有严格的安全策略，并经过第三方测试。\r\n- 厂商提供哪些支持？\r\n  - 厂商提供的技术支持将极大地影响潜在成本以及部署、排除故障和优化 EDR 解决方案的能力。\r\n\r\n# 3. 参考资料\r\n- [https://docs.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=https://resource.redcanary.com/rs/003-YRU-314/images/EDR-Buyers-Guide-2020.pdf](https://docs.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=https://resource.redcanary.com/rs/003-YRU-314/images/EDR-Buyers-Guide-2020.pdf)"}]}}}
