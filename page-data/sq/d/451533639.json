You can go back with `ctrl+-`. Here, go to your [[inbox]]\r\n\r\n- [ ] to see how your notes are connected, execute the `Foam: Show Graph` command. See [[graph-visualization]].\r\n\r\n- [ ] #tags can be used to further organize your content. Look at the `Tag Explorer` view on the left panel to find and navigate the tags in your knowledge base. See [[tags-and-tag-explorer]].\r\n\r\n- [ ] Foam supports [[spell-checking]].\r\n\r\n- [ ] You can also paste images in your Foam, just press `cmd+alt+v` to create the image file and link to it from your note. See [[paste-images-from-clipboard]].\r\n\r\n- [ ] You can use Foam for your daily notes, or journaling. Execute now the `Foam: Open Daily Note` command to create a new file in your `journal` folder. See [[daily-notes]].\r\n\r\n- [ ] Want to see how to manage your tasks? Go to the [[todo]] note\r\n\r\n- [ ] The section at the end of this file contains wikilink definitions, which enable navigation of your notes from GitHub's web UI, and in general to make `[[wikilinks]]` understood by any markdown parser. See [[link-reference-definitions]].\r\n\r\n- [ ] To explore all the Foam settings, press `cmd+,`, then `Extensions > Foam`\r\n\r\n- [ ] Living within VsCode, Foam can be customized in many ways! Look at the [Foam Recipes](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recipes/recipes) for ideas!\r\n\r\n- [ ] Join the [Foam community on Discord](https://foambubble.github.io/join-discord/e), introduce yourself and leave a message on how you found Foam and how the onboarding went :) We are always keen to do better\r\n\r\n- [ ] Take the [Foam Welcome survey](http://foambubble.github.io/welcome-survey/e)! It helps us better understand your need and how we can make Foam better and better for you :)\r\n\r\n## Advanced Features\r\n\r\n- [ ] You can create [[note-templates]] for things like book reviews, people, daily notes (coming soon), and more!\r\n\r\n## About Foam\r\n\r\nFoam doesn't do all this magic on its own, it relies on some amazing extensions.

No vendor lock-in. The less vendor features you use, the better you'll be able to migrate. `[[Wikilink]]` is the only non-markdown feature supported by default, but nonetheless, it is recommended to use the standard markdown syntax, or if you edit with [Foam](https://github.com/foambubble/foam), please use [Wikilink](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/wikilinks) with [Link Reference Definitions](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/features/link-reference-definitions). That give us the capability change our theme, or hosted place.\r\n2. Use meta data instead of special characters. We should use `tags` as the document's metadata, not `#tag` in the plain text.\r\n3. Use tags instead of categories. Minimal subfolders.\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\n\r\n### For new wiki\r\n\r\nThis documentation assumes that you have a GitHub account and have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed on your Linux/MacOS/Windows machine.\r\n\r\n1. If you haven't yet, browse over to the main [Foam documentation](https://foambubble.github.io/foam) to get an idea of what Foam is and how to use it.\r\n2. Press \"Use this template\" button at [foam-template-gatsby-theme-primer-wiki](https://github.com/theowenyoung/foam-template-gatsby-theme-primer-wiki/generate) (that's this repository!) to fork it to your own GitHub account. If you want to keep your thoughts to yourself, remember to set the repository private.\r\n3. [Clone the repository to your local machine](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) and open it in VS Code.\r\n\r\n   _Open the repository as a folder using the `File > Open...` menu item._\r\n\r\n4. When prompted to install recommended extensions, click **Install all** (or **Show Recommendations** if you want to review and install them one by one)\r\n5. Delete all `.md` files you don't need, Change Site settings at `.layouts/gatsby-config.js`, change your CNAME at `.layouts/static/CNAME`, change your icon at `.layouts/static/logo.png`, commit your changes, and push to github, change your page settings at Github, make sure you set the page branch to `gh-pages`, then when github actions runed, you can visit your site.\r\n\r\nAfter setting up the repository, head to [[getting-started]] to get familiar with your new knowledge base!\r\n\r\nTo learn more about how to use **Foam**, read the [Recipes](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recipes/recipes) bubbles of the Foam documentation workspace.\r\n\r\nAnd remember that you can always join our [Foam community on Discord](https://foambubble.github.io/join-discord/g)!\r\n\r\n### For exist wiki\r\n\r\n### Exist Wiki\r\n\r\n1.

(https://github.com/fastly/ftw)**，由 ModSecurity 和 Fastly 的研究人员创建，旨在帮助为 WAF 规则提供严格的测试。它使用 OWASP Core Ruleset V3 作为基线来测试 WAF 上的规则。规则集中的每个规则都加载到一个 YAML 文件中，该文件发出将触发这些规则的 HTTP 请求。\r\n- **GoTestWAF(https://github.com/wallarm/gotestwaf)**，由另一家 WAF 供应商 Wallarm 负责维护。GoTestWAF 使用 YAML 来定义多个测试，这些测试使用不同的有效载荷变体、绕过技术、编码以及有效载荷插入点（包括模拟 API 调用的 JSON 结构）。 本文使用GoTestWAF进行测试。\r\n- **WAFLab(https://github.com/microsoft/waflab)**，微软出品，使用 YAML 来定义多个测试用例，默认使用modsecurity的规则进行验证。\r\n\r\n# 2. GoTestWAF 如何工作？\r\nGoTestWAF 生成具有预定义的基本有效负载的请求以及特定于不同 API（REST、SOAP、XMLRPC）的攻击。之后，它将它们发送到应用程序并分析响应以在控制台输出中生成详细报告或作为 PDF。\r\n\r\n主要测试思路是将攻击载荷编码并放置在 HTTP 请求的不同部分：其正文、标头、URL 参数等。为了简化，实现了以下逻辑：\r\n\r\n- **有效载荷 → 编码器 → 占位符**\r\n\r\n这意味着每个负载样本（恶意攻击样本，例如像“alert(1)”这样的 XSS 字符串）将首先以某种方式编码，然后放入 HTTP 请求中。还可以选择使用保持字符串原样的普通编码器。\r\n\r\n为了使测试可读，GoTestWAF 使用 YAML DSL。以下是 SQL 注入负载的示例：\r\n\r\n```\r\npayload:\r\n  '\"union select -7431.1, name, @aaa from u_base--w-'\r\n  \"'or 123.22=123.22\"\r\n  \"' waitfor delay '00:00:10'--\"\r\n  \"')) or pg_sleep(5)--\"\r\nencoder:\r\n  Base64Flat\r\n  Url  \r\nplaceholder:\r\n  UrlPath\r\n  UrlParam\r\n  JsonBody\r\n  Header\r\n```\r\n\r\n作为每 4 个有效载荷、2 个编码器和 4 个占位符的排列结果，本次测试将发送 424=32 个请求。\r\n\r\n# 3. WAFLab 是怎样的？\r\n使用AutoGen模块自动生成测试用例，大体思路和GoTestWAF差不多，值得一提的是，它会从Mod Security的规则中提取信息，不过整体数量还是蛮少的：\r\n\r\n| TYPE                                | Total Rule | Supported Rule | Passed Rule |\r\n|

每秒处理3200 万次 HTTP 请求，22% web 服务器为 [W3Techs](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/ws-cloudflare) 所知的网站使用 Cloudflare。Cloudflare 为五分之一的互联网资产保护其流量，因而具备独特的优势，得以在威胁出现时就加以识别，并跟踪其进化和变异。\r\n\r\nWeb 应用程序防火墙（WAF）处于 Cloudflare 安全工具箱的核心位置，而托管规则是 [WAF](https://www.cloudflare.com/zh-cn/learning/ddos/glossary/web-application-firewall-waf/) 的关键功能。托管规则是 Cloudflare 分析师团队创建的一组规则，用于阻止显示已知攻击模式的请求。这些托管规则攻击对于现有攻击手段的模式非常有效，因为它们已经过广泛测试，能最大限度减少误报。托管规则的不足之处是，常常会错过攻击的变体（也称为绕过），因为基于静态正则表达式的规则本质上对引入的特征变体（如通过模糊技术）敏感。\r\n\r\n在[[log4j]]漏洞爆发的时候，由于攻击者尝试绕过 WAF，Cloudflare必须不断更新规则来匹配变种。此外，优化规则需要大量的人工干预，而且通常要在绕过被识别或甚至被利用后才能起作用，导致保护变得被动。\r\n\r\n为了解决这个问题，Cloudflare提供一个新工具，旨在无需人工干预的情况下识别绕过和恶意负载，以防其造成破坏。现在客户能够从一个机器学习模型中获取信号，这个模型根据托管规则和分类的善意/恶意流量和增强数据来训练，从而针对更大范围的新老攻击提供更佳的保护。\r\n\r\n# 2. 第一个自我学习的 WAF\r\n全新检测系统增强现有的托管规则集，提供三大优势：\r\n1.  适用于您的所有流量。系统会根据每个请求包含 SQLi 或 XSS 攻击等的可能性对其进行评分。这实现了一种全新的 WAF 分析体验，让您能够探索自己整体流量中的趋势和模式。\r\n2.  检测速率根据过去的流量和反馈而改善。托管规则集将所有 Cloudflare 流量分类为善意/恶意流量后，提供给该模型进行训练。这样一来，小型网站也能获得与大型网站同级的保护。\r\n3.  性能的新定义该机器学习模型在绕过和异常被利用或被人类研究人员识别前就将其识别出来。\r\n\r\n其中秘诀在于如下几方面的结合：创新的机器学习建模，庞大的训练数据集（基于我们每天阻止的攻击，以及数据增强技术），基于行为测试原则的正确评估和测试框架，以及让我们在几乎毫不增加延迟的前提下评估每一个请求的尖端工程技术。\r\n\r\n# 3. 新的 WAF 体验\r\n全新检测系统基于与[机器人分析（Bot Analytics）](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-bot-analytics/) 一同发布的范式。根据这一方法，无论我们是否采取行动，都会对每个请求进行评估并赋分。由于我们对每一个请求赋分，针对发送到用户服务器的全部流量，用户能够看到分数如何随着时间变化。\r\n\r\n![3STXCU](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/MarsAuthority/sec_pic@master/uPic/2023-01/3STXCU.jpg)\r\n\r\n此外，用户还可以查看请求的特定攻击手段（如SQLi的）评分直方图，并找到合适的评分值来区分善意流量和恶意流量。配置的规则如下图：\r\n\r\n![tVmqXg](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/MarsAuthority/sec_pic@master/uPic/2023-01/tVmqXg.jpg)\r\n\r\n# 4. 工作原理\r\n\r\n基于机器学习的检测补充了现有的托管规则集，例如 OWASP 和 Cloudflare 托管规则。这套系统基于旨在没有研究人员或最终用户直接监督的情况下识别攻击模式变体或异常的模型。\r\n\r\n截至今日，Cloudflare已经公开两种攻击手段的分数：SQL 注入（SQLi）和跨站点脚本（XSS）。用户能根据三个单独的分数来创建自定义 WAF/防火墙规则：总分 （`cf.waf.ml.score`），SQLi 分数和 XSS 分数（分别为 `cf.waf.ml.score.sqli`，`cf.waf.ml.score.xss`,）。这些分数介于 1-99，其中 1 为绝对恶意，99 代表有效流量。\r\n\r\n![CSU2ZS](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/MarsAuthority/sec_pic@master/uPic/2023-01/CSU2ZS.jpg)\r\n\r\n然后，我们使用现有 WAF 规则分类的流量对该模型进行训练，它对原始请求的一个变异版本有效，使其更容易识别攻击的指纹。\r\n\r\n对于每个请求，该模型对请求的每个部分独立评分，从而有可能识别恶意负载所在的位置，例如，在请求的正文、URI 或标头中。\r\n\r\n![EZsUM7](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/MarsAuthority/sec_pic@master/uPic/2023-01/EZsUM7.jpg)\r\n\r\n这看起来很简单，但 Cloudflare 的工程师需要解决一系列挑战才能做到。其中包括：如何建立一个可靠的数据集，可扩展的数据标签，选择正确的模型架构，以及要求对 Cloudflare 全球网络处理的每一个请求（每秒 3200 万个）执行分类。\r\n\r\n# 5. 参考资料\r\n- [通过机器学习改善 WAF (cloudflare.com)](https://blog.cloudflare.com/zh-cn/waf-ml-zh-cn/)"},{"fields":{"slug":"/安全知识库/Blue

Gigamon Solution\r\n- **无源TAP**\r\n  - 无源TAP是在其网络端口之间没有物理隔离的设备，它从网络的两个方向接收流量，以便在监视工具上看到100％的流量。无源TAP不需要任何电源，增加了一层冗余，几乎不需要维护，并减少了总费用。\r\n- **有源TAP**\r\n  - 有源TAP在网络端口之间具有物理隔离。因此，它们需要一种故障安全机制，以确保在TAP断电时网络保持可操作状态；**有源TAP通常在下面的场景使用（无源TAP不适用）**：\r\n    1. Locations where the light levels are too low to use a splitter → regeneration provides a viable solution\r\n    2. Copper infrastructures → where electricity is used to move electrons (instead of photons)\r\n    3. Signal conversions → since an active TAP regenerates the signal anyway, it can also be designed to create a signal of a different type (such as 10Gb SR converted to 10Gb LR)\r\n    4. SFP-based links that cannot otherwise be broken (such as TwinAX cabling) → regeneration works here as well\r\n- **虚拟TAP**\r\n  - 用于网络功能虚拟化 (NFV) 以及私有和公共云基础架构，以访问托管环境中的东西向和南北向流量。\r\n  - ![hKxsTy](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/MarsAuthority/sec_pic@master/uPic/2022-12/hKxsTy.jpg)\r\n\r\n# 4. 参考资料\r\n- [https://www.gigamon.com/resources/resource-library/white-paper/to-tap-or-to-span.html](https://www.gigamon.com/resources/resource-library/white-paper/to-tap-or-to-span.html)\r\n- [https://www.gigamon.com/resources/resource-library/white-paper/understanding-network-taps-first-step-to-visibility.html](https://www.gigamon.com/resources/resource-library/white-paper/understanding-network-taps-first-step-to-visibility.html)\r\n- [https://www.secrss.com/articles/12651](https://www.secrss.com/articles/12651)\r\n- [http://blog.nsfocus.net/east-west-flow-sum](http://blog.nsfocus.net/east-west-flow-sum)"},{"fields":{"slug":"/安全知识库/Blue Team基础设施/终端基础设施/EDR/2021 EPP魔力象限 EPP Magic Quadrant/","title":"2021 EPP魔力象限 EPP Magic Quadrant"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\r\ntitle: 2021 EPP魔力象限 EPP Magic Quadrant\r\ntags:\r\n- Blue Team基础设施\r\n- 终端基础设施\r\n- EDR\r\n---\r\n\r\n![https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/MarsAuthority/sec_pic@master/uPic/2023-01/ZP3Qyi.jpg](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/MarsAuthority/sec_pic@master/uPic/2023-01/ZP3Qyi.jpg)\r\n\r\n# 1. 市场趋势\r\n- 到 2023 年底，云交付的 EPP 解决方案将超过 95% 。\r\n- 到 2025 年，50% 使用 EDR 的组织将使用托管检测和响应功能（MDR）。\r\n- 到 2025 年，60% 的 EDR 解决方案将包含来自多个安全控制源的数据，例如身份认证、CASB 和 DLP。\r\n\r\n# 2. 市场定义/描述\r\n- Gartner对EPP市场的定义如下：EPP提供了将agent或sensor部署到托管终端（包括 PC、服务器和其他设备）的工具；这些旨在防止一系列已知和未知的恶意软件和威胁，并提供免受此类威胁的保护；此外，它们还提供调查和补救任何逃避保护控制的事件的能力。\r\n- EPP的核心功能是：\r\n  -

首先，服务器业务进程优先级高，HIDS Agent进程自己可以终止，但不能影响宿主机的主要业务，这是第一要点，那么业务需要具备熔断功能，并具备自我恢复能力。\r\n  - 其次，进程保活、维持心跳、实时获取新指令能力，百万台Agent的全量控制时间一定要短。举个极端的例子，当Agent出现紧急情况，需要全量停止时，那么全量停止的命令下发，需要在1-2分钟内完成，甚至30秒、20秒内完成。这些将会是很大的技术挑战。\r\n  - 还有对配置动态更新，日志级别控制，细分精确控制到每个Agent上的每个HIDS子进程，能自由地控制每个进程的启停，每个Agent的参数，也能精确的感知每台Agent的上线、下线情况。\r\n  - 同时，Agent本身是安全Agent，安全的因素也要考虑进去，包括通信通道的安全性，配置管理的安全性等等。\r\n  - 最后，服务端也要有一致性保障、可用性保障，对于大量Agent的管理，必须能实现任务分摊，并行处理任务，且保证数据的一致性。考虑到公司规模不断地扩大，业务不断地增多，特别是美团和大众点评合并后，面对的各种操作系统问题，产品还要具备良好的兼容性、可维护性等。\r\n  - 总结下来，产品架构要符合以下特性：\r\n    - 集群高可用。\r\n    - 分布式，去中心化。\r\n    - 配置一致性，配置多版本可追溯。\r\n    - 分治与汇总。\r\n    - 兼容部署各种Linux 服务器，只维护一个版本。\r\n    - 节省资源，占用较少的CPU、内存。\r\n    - 精确的熔断限流。\r\n    - 服务器数量规模达到百万级的集群负载能力。\r\n\r\n# 5. 技术难点：\r\n在列出产品需要实现的功能点、技术点后，再来分析下遇到的技术挑战，包括不限于以下几点：\r\n\r\n- 资源限制，较小的CPU、内存。\r\n- 五十万甚至一百万台服务器的Agent处理控制问题。\r\n- 量级大了后，集群控制带来的控制效率，响应延迟，数据一致性问题。\r\n- 量级大了后，数据传输对整个服务器内网带来的流量冲击问题。\r\n- 量级大了后，运行环境更复杂，Agent异常表现的感知问题。\r\n- 量级大了后，业务日志、程序运行日志的传输、存储问题，被监控业务访问量突增带来监控数据联突增，对内网带宽，存储集群的爆发压力问题。\r\n\r\n我们可以看到，技术难点几乎都是服务器到达一定量级带来的，对于大量的服务，集群分布式是业界常见的解决方案。\r\n\r\n# 6. 架构设计与技术选型\r\n对于管理Agent的服务端来说，要实现高可用、容灾设计，那么一定要做多机房部署，就一定会遇到数据一致性问题。那么数据的存储，就要考虑分布式存储组件。 分布式数据存储中，存在一个定理叫`CAP定理`：\r\n\r\n![lxjgAk](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/MarsAuthority/sec_pic@master/uPic/2023-01/lxjgAk.jpg)\r\n\r\n**CAP的解释**:\r\n- 关于`CAP定理`，分为以下三点：\r\n  - 一致性（Consistency）：分布式数据库的数据保持一致。\r\n  - 可用性（Availability）：任何一个节点宕机，其他节点可以继续对外提供服务。\r\n  - 分区容错性（网络分区）Partition Tolerance：一个数据库所在的机器坏了，如硬盘坏了，数据丢失了，可以添加一台机器，然后从其他正常的机器把备份的数据同步过来。\r\n- 根据定理，分布式系统只能满足三项中的两项而不可能满足全部三项。理解CAP定理的最简单方式是想象两个节点分处分区两侧。允许至少一个节点更新状态会导致数据不一致，即丧失了Consistency。如果为了保证数据一致性，将分区一侧的节点设置为不可用，那么又丧失了Availability。除非两个节点可以互相通信，才能既保证Consistency又保证Availability，这又会导致丧失Partition Tolerance。\r\n- 参见：[CAP Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem)\r\n\r\n**CAP的选择**:\r\n- 为了容灾上设计，集群节点的部署，会选择的异地多机房，所以 「Partition tolerance」是不可能避免的。那么可选的是 `AP` 与 `CP`。\r\n- 在HIDS集群的场景里，各个Agent对集群持续可用性没有非常强的要求，在短暂时间内，是可以出现异常，出现无法通讯的情况。但最终状态必须要一致，不能存在集群下发关停指令，而出现个别Agent不听从集群控制的情况出现。所以，我们需要一个满足 `CP` 的产品。\r\n\r\n# 7. 满足CP的产品选择\r\n  - 在开源社区中，比较出名的几款满足CP的产品，比如etcd、ZooKeeper、Consul等。我们需要根据几款产品的特点，根据我们需求来选择符合我们需求的产品。\r\n  - 插一句，网上很多人说Consul是AP产品，这是个错误的描述。既然Consul支持分布式部署，那么一定会出现「网络分区」的问题， 那么一定要支持「Partition tolerance」。另外，在consul的官网上自己也提到了这点 Consul uses a CP architecture, favoring consistency over availability.\r\n  \r\n    > Consul is opinionated in its usage while Serf is a more flexible and general purpose tool. In CAP terms, Consul uses a CP architecture, favoring consistency over availability. Serf is an AP system and sacrifices consistency for availability. This means Consul cannot operate if the central servers cannot form a quorum while Serf will continue to function under almost all circumstances.\r\n\r\n  - **etcd、ZooKeeper、Consul对比**\r\n\r\n    - 借用etcd官网上etcd与ZooKeeper和Consul的比较图。\r\n    - ![XotcyC](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/MarsAuthority/sec_pic@master/uPic/2023-01/XotcyC.jpg)\r\n    - 在我们HIDS Agent的需求中，除了基本的`服务发现` 、`配置同步` 、`配置多版本控制` 、`变更通知`等基本需求外，我们还有基于产品安全性上的考虑，比如`传输通道加密`、`用户权限控制`、`角色管理`、`基于Key的权限设定`等，这点 `etcd` 比较符合我们要求。很多大型公司都在使用，比如`Kubernetes`、`AWS`、`OpenStack`、`Azure`、`Google Cloud`、`Huawei Cloud`等，并且`etcd`的社区支持非常好。基于这几点因素，我们选择etcd作为HIDS的分布式集群管理。\r\n\r\n# 8. 分布式HIDS集群架构图\r\n![c09vZx](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/MarsAuthority/sec_pic@master/uPic/2023-01/c09vZx.jpg)\r\n\r\n# 9. 编程语言选择\r\n考虑到公司服务器量大，业务复杂，需求环境多变，操作系统可能包括各种Linux以及Windows等。为了保证系统的兼容性，我们选择了Golang作为开发语言，它具备以下特点：\r\n\r\n- 可以静态编译，直接通过syscall来运行，不依赖libc，兼容性高，可以在所有Linux上执行，部署便捷。\r\n- 静态编译语言，能将简单的错误在编译前就发现。\r\n- 具备良好的GC机制，占用系统资源少，开发成本低。\r\n- 容器化的很多产品都是Golang编写，比如Kubernetes、Docker等。\r\n- etcd项目也是Golang编写，类库、测试用例可以直接用，SDK支持快速。\r\n- 良好的CSP并发模型支持，高效的协程调度机制。\r\n\r\n# 10. 产品架构大方向\r\n  - HIDS产品研发完成后，部署的服务都运行着各种业务的服务器，业务的重要性排在第一，我们产品的功能排在后面。为此，确定了几个产品的大方向：\r\n    - 高可用，数据一致，可横向扩展。\r\n    - 容灾性好，能应对机房级的网络故障。\r\n    - 兼容性好，只维护一个版本的Agent。\r\n    - 依赖低，不依赖任何动态链接库。\r\n    - 侵入性低，不做Hook，不做系统类库更改。\r\n    - 熔断降级可靠，宁可自己挂掉，也不影响业务 。\r\n\r\n# 11. 框架设计\r\n![XMnpix](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/MarsAuthority/sec_pic@master/uPic/2023-01/XMnpix.jpg)\r\n\r\n如上图，在框架的设计上，封装常用类库，抽象化定义`Interface`，剥离`etcd Client`，全局化`Logger`，抽象化App的启动、退出方法。使得各`模块`（以下简称`App`）只需要实现自己的业务即可，可以方便快捷的进行逻辑编写，无需关心底层实现、配置来源、重试次数、熔断方案等等。\r\n\r\n后面不再copy，感兴趣请参考原文"},{"fields":{"slug":"/安全知识库/Blue Team基础设施/终端基础设施/EDR商业化产品/CrowdStrike Falcon/","title":"CrowdStrike Falcon"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\r\ntitle: CrowdStrike Falcon\r\ntags:\r\n- Blue Team基础设施\r\n- 终端基础设施\r\n- EDR商业化产品\r\n- CrowdStrike\r\n---\r\n\r\n# 1.

CrowdStrike EDR 是如何工作的？\r\n- EDR解决方案的工作原理是提供对终端上发生事情的持续和全面的实时检测/监控。然后将行为分析和可操作的情报应用于终端数据，以阻止攻击告警演变为安全事件。功能包括：\r\n  - **1. 自动发现未知攻击者**\r\n    - Falcon Insight 将所有终端的遥测数据与IOA配对，并使用其行为来分析数十亿事件，自动检测可疑行为的痕迹；如果一系列事件和告警与已知 IOA匹配，agent将把该活动标记为恶意并自动发送告警；用户还可以编写自己的搜索条件，Falcon Insight的云架构可在5 秒或更短的时间内返回查询结果。\r\n  - **2. 与威胁情报集成**\r\n    - 可以更快地检测被识别为恶意的TTPs，并提供了上下文信息，其中包括相关的归因，提供有关攻击者的详细信息以及有关攻击的任何其他信息。\r\n  - **3. 主动防御，托管式威胁狩猎**\r\n    - 作为 Falcon 平台的一部分，Falcon OverWatch™ 托管威胁追踪服务增加了一个额外的保护能力，安全专家会帮助客户采取行动，以确保不会遗漏威胁，并最终防止发生大规模泄露。\r\n  - **4. 提供实时/历史的可见性**\r\n    - Falcon Insight就像终端上的 DVR，记录相关活动以捕捉尝试绕过检测的安全事件；Falcon agent跟踪了数百个不同的安全相关事件，例如进程创建、驱动程序加载、注册表修改、磁盘访问、内存访问或网络连接等，客户可以从安全角度全面了解其终端上发生的一切。\r\n    - 这为安全团队提供了他们需要的有用信息，包括：\r\n      - 内外与外部的网络连接\r\n      - 直接/远程登录的所有用户帐户\r\n      - ASP 密钥的变更、可执行文件和管理工具的使用\r\n      - 进程执行\r\n      - 详细的进程级别的网络活动，包括 DNS 请求、连接和开放端口\r\n      - 存档文件创建，包括 RAR 和 ZIPS\r\n      - USB等外部存储介质\r\n  - **5. 加速调查**\r\n    - 能够加快调查和最终修复的速度，因为从终端收集的信息通过Falcon 平台存储在 CrowdStrike 云中，使用了一个图形数据库来跟踪每个终端事件之间的所有关系和联系，该数据库可以快速、大规模地提供历史和实时数据的详细信息和上下文，这使安全团队能够有效地跟踪即使是最复杂的攻击，并及时发现事件，并对它们进行分类、验证和确定优先级，从而更快、更精确地进行补救。\r\n  - **6. 实现快速的修复**\r\n    - Falcon Insight 可以隔离终端，它允许组织通过将可能受到威胁的主机与所有网络活动隔离开来采取迅速和即时的行动。当终端受被隔离，它仍然可以从 CrowdStrike 云发送和接收信息，但即使与云的连接被切断，它仍将保持被隔离，并在重新启动期间保持这种隔离状态。\r\n    - **在应对新出现的威胁时，时间至关重要，响应者需要实时、深入的可见性，以便他们能够快速果断地进行补救。**\r\n    - **信息收集器**允许安全团队通过执行以下任务，以了解威胁的风险和范围：\r\n      - 浏览文件系统并提取文件\r\n      - 列出正在运行的进程\r\n      - 提取 Windows 事件日志\r\n      - 查询 Windows 注册表\r\n      - 列出当前的网络连接和配置\r\n      - 提取进程内存\r\n      - 计算文件哈希\r\n      - 收集环境变量\r\n      - 使用 PowerShell 或其他工具收集其他所需信息\r\n    - **补救措施**使团队能够迅速而果断地采取行动来遏制或补救威胁，包括：\r\n      - 删除文件\r\n      - 结束一个进程\r\n      - 删除或修改 Windows 注册表项或值\r\n      - 上传文件\r\n      - 运行脚本或可执行文件\r\n      - 加密文件\r\n      - 重启/关机\r\n- 借助 CrowdStrike 的云原生架构、轻量级agent和统一控制台，实时响应功能可以交付到世界上任何地方的任何系统，而对成本或性能的影响几乎为零。\r\n\r\n# 3. 参考资料\r\n- [https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/indicators-of-compromise/ioa-vs-ioc/](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/indicators-of-compromise/ioa-vs-ioc/)\r\n- [https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/endpoint-security/endpoint-detection-and-response-edr/](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/endpoint-security/endpoint-detection-and-response-edr/)"},{"fields":{"slug":"/安全知识库/Blue Team基础设施/终端基础设施/EDR能力评估/MITRE EDR技术能力评估/","title":"MITRE EDR技术能力评估"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\r\ntitle: MITRE EDR技术能力评估\r\ntags:\r\n- Blue Team基础设施\r\n- 终端基础设施\r\n- EDR能力评估\r\n- 能力评估\r\n- MITRE\r\n---\r\n\r\n# 1. 背景\r\nMITRE每年会举办一次安全产品能力评估，通过ATT&CK和真实的APT案例进行攻击模拟，最大程度环境真实的攻击场景，整体过程分为以下三步：\r\n- **1. 设计阶段**\r\n  -

![9P2IbH](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/MarsAuthority/sec_pic@master/uPic/2023-01/9P2IbH.jpg)\r\n  - 厂商提供的解决方案：MDR和MSSP。\r\n- 部署时对业务有什么影响？\r\n  - EDR 解决方案应该可以使用任何本机或第三方部署实用程序轻松部署到终端。 需要重启的解决方案可能会产生重大的业务影响，并需要更多的组织协调。\r\n- 能否取代现有的终端安全方案？\r\n  - 今天的许多 EDR 解决方案并不直接取代常见的安全方案，而是专注于加强安全态势的特定部分；常见的现有终端安全方案有：\r\n    - 杀毒软件、DLP、FIM、HIDS、UBA等。\r\n\r\n**技术能力**\r\n- 支持哪些平台和操作系统？\r\n  - 理想情况下，单一解决方案将适用于服务器、PC、笔记本电脑和其他终端。\r\n- 提供什么级别的可见性？\r\n  - 如果 EDR 缺乏对数据的收集，则它的价值有限； 把它想象成一个物理安全系统：光学安全摄像头远不如能同时收集 X 射线、红外线和振动数据的摄像头。\r\n  - 常见的数据包含：进程信息、网络连接、文件修改记录、注册表记录、二进制文件、内容、用户信息等。\r\n- 如何与预防措施相结合？\r\n  - EDR 解决方案越来越多地成为终端保护平台的一部分，而不是独立的工具。 选择具有“多合一”的解决方案非常重要。\r\n- 如何检测面临的威胁？\r\n  - 了解 EDR 解决方案检测到的威胁类型以及使用的技术和技巧应该是评估的核心。 许多解决方案采用非常有限的检测方法，并且无法提供更广泛的威胁覆盖范围。\r\n  - 包含：覆盖范围、误报率、漏报率、响应时间、有效性等。\r\n- 提供什么样的响应处置能力？\r\n  - 需要能够立即对威胁做出反应并在它对您的组织造成更大损害之前阻止它。\r\n- 有哪些类型的报告可用？\r\n  - EDR 解决方案提供的报告对于获得的价值至关重要；这适用于随每个威胁检测提供的报告以及有关终端和企业的摘要报告。\r\n\r\n**安全能力整合**\r\n- 是否与其他安全工具集成/联动？\r\n  - 将 EDR 深度集成到现有的安全能力和 IT 工具，能够最有效地从解决方案中获得最大价值。\r\n- 对终端会造成什么影响?\r\n  - 几乎所有 EDR 解决方案都通过Agent方式部署到终端，这意味着如果它没有经过良好的设计和测试，可能会产生严重的性能影响并导致不稳定。 应该提供在类似操作系统和硬件上测试的性能数据，以及在运行类似应用程序时的性能数据。\r\n- 使用哪些安全控制来保护自己免受攻击者的攻击？\r\n  - 如果设计不当，EDR 解决方案可能会带来巨大的安全风险；确保EDR自身都有严格的安全策略，并经过第三方测试。\r\n- 厂商提供哪些支持？\r\n  - 厂商提供的技术支持将极大地影响潜在成本以及部署、排除故障和优化 EDR 解决方案的能力。\r\n\r\n# 3. 参考资料\r\n- [https://docs.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=https://resource.redcanary.com/rs/003-YRU-314/images/EDR-Buyers-Guide-2020.pdf](https://docs.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=https://resource.redcanary.com/rs/003-YRU-314/images/EDR-Buyers-Guide-2020.pdf)"}]}}}
